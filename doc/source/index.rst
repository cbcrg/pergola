Welcome to Pergola's documentation!
===================================

The advent of new technologies in the field of behavioral neuroscience and other disciplines allows for the collection
of big chunks of longitudinal data. Hence, powerful analysis and visualization tools are increasingly necessary.

Dealing with such a huge amount of data is not a new problem in biology. Other biological disciplines such as genomics
have long  develop software tools for the analysis of big data. This observation will be anecdotal if genomics data were
not often sequential and hence share a similar structure with longitudinal data.

Pushing this observation further, Pergola process your longitudinal data adopting widely-used genomic formats.
This way, Pergola makes your data compliant with powerful genomics software tools, simplifying its analysis and
visualization.
