Welcome to Pergola's documentation!
===================================

Pergola is a set of python modules for transforming your data in data visualizable
in common genome browser

The advent of new technologies in the field of behavioral neuroscience allows for the collection 
of big chunks of longitudinal data. Dealing with such a huge amount of data sometimes is difficult 
and it is very important to have good visualization tools so that we let data “speak”. However, this 
problem is not new in biology and other disciplines, such as genomics, have long dealt with it. 
So why not take advantage of it? pergola aims is to be a simple tool for behavioral data manipulation 
in order to visualize data in popular genome browsers.
