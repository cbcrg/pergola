run (operating system, software, libraries and dependencies) in a container. 
Besides avoiding the tedious process of installing all dependencies, the use of 
Pergola docker images provides the extra benefit of guarantee the reproducibility 
of your results. Regardless your operating system and the software installed in 
your machine, you can always run your computation under the same environment and 
the same version of Pergola using the tag of the image.
